# Case of study: "Mushroom classification".

The dataset (available at the [link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/mushroom-classification/data) includes descriptions of 23 species of gilled mushrooms in the Agaricus and Lepiota Family Mushroom drawn from The Audubon Society Field Guide to North American Mushrooms (1981). Each species is identified as definitely edible, definitely poisonous, or of unknown edibility and not recommended. This latter class was combined with the poisonous one.\
The goal of the project is to predict the edibility
